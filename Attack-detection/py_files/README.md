## Python modules for NIDS using ANN with PSO-DE optimisation

**Note**: Refer to ![Requirements](requirements.md) for the libraries required to run the python script.

The python file contains two .py files - ANN_PSO_DE.py and test_PSO_DE.

* ![ANN_PSO_DE.py](ANN_PSO_DE.py) - It contains an Artificial Neural Network model optimised using a hybrid of Particle Swarm      Optimiser and Differential Evolution for the Network Anomaly Detection.


* ![test_PSO_DE.py](test_PSO_DE.py) - It contains a reduced form of the above hybrid optimiser used to evaluate various characteristics such as convergence rate, precision, robustness, and the overall performance.

    Functions used - Rastrigin function, Sphere function, Ackley function, and Eggholder function.
