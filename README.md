# packcap - A Packet Capture tool.

### This uses the libpcap library as it's base.


### Follow the steps to install the tool:

1. Pull the sourcecode from https://github.com/Rithesh17/Network-Monitoring-Tool.git

2. Navigate to "src" directory.

3. $chmod u+x build.sh

4. $./build.sh

5. $sudo ./a.out

And the tool is up and running.


There will be 2 new files in the directory.
1. Pcap Dump file: This can be opened by any tool like wireshark to analyze packets.

2. CSV file: This file literally has all the details about every single packet. For it to be more readable , Opening it using MSExcel or Google Slides would be a good idea.
